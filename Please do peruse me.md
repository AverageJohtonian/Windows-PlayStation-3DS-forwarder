## What is this?
If you’ve ever tried to inject PlayStation games on your 3DS, you may know the struggle, Sakitoshi's injector and NSUI are great tools made by awesome people but some games just refuse to run due to outdated cores, while others lag or chop like a badly cut video during cutscenes. Here enters our hero! I’ve found this shiny new tool from 2023 that brings you newer, smoother cores and way better compatibility!

## I might do (no promises)
- A GUI. (I really doubt it I do this, sorry)
- A video tutorial.

## Thanks to
- [Luke Willis](https://github.com/SirFluffDev) for creating the original tool.
- [Leap](https://github.com/leapbtw) for fixing an error with create.sh.
- [CrystalTikal](https://gbatemp.net/members/crystaltikal.702551/) for creating a [tutorial](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-ps1-forwarder-creator.550175/post-10490719) on how to use it on Windows.
