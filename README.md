## What is this?
If you’ve ever tried to inject PlayStation games on your 3DS, you may know the struggle, Sakitoshi's injector and NSUI are great tools made by awesome people but some games just refuse to run due to outdated cores, while others lag or chop like a badly cut video during cutscenes. Here enters our hero! I’ve found this shiny new tool from 2023 that brings you newer, smoother cores and way better compatibility!

**So long story short, it's a Windows version of SirFluffDev's tool so you don't have to get the Windows versions of the tool yourself.**

### A video tutorial is coming (can't tell if soon).

## Thanks to
- [Luke Willis](https://github.com/SirFluffDev) for creating the original tool.
- [Leap](https://github.com/leapbtw) for fixing an error with create.sh.
- [CrystalTikal](https://gbatemp.net/members/crystaltikal.702551/) for creating a [tutorial](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-ps1-forwarder-creator.550175/post-10490719) on how to use it on Windows.

## Known bugs
- **There's a little chance the game won't start at all**, this is most common in old 3DS users. If that's your case, you'll have to inject your game again.
- **Don't panic if your game won't save the first time you open it.** From what I experienced, your save is still there somewhere. My recomendation is to open and re-open the game.
