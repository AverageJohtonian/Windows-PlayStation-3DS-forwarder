## What is this?
If you’ve ever tried to inject PlayStation games on your 3DS, you may know the struggle, Sakitoshi's injector and NSUI are great tools made by awesome people but some games just refuse to run due to outdated cores, while others lag or chop like a badly cut video during cutscenes. Here enters our hero! I’ve found this shiny new tool from 2023 that brings you newer, smoother cores and way better compatibility!

**So long story short, it's a Windows version of SirFluffDev's tool so you don't have to get the Windows versions of the tool yourself.**

### A video tutorial is coming (can't tell if soon).

## Thanks to
